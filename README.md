# Diabetes_Prediction
Machine Learning project with Support Vector Machine algorithm in Python


Diabetes Prediction using Python
This project aims to predict diabetes using Python, based on patient information contained in a CSV file.

Requirements
The following packages must be installed to run the project:

pandas
numpy
sklearn
Data
The data used in this project is contained in a CSV file named "diabetes.csv". The data consists of various health metrics for patients, including their age, blood pressure, BMI, and more.

Usage
To run the project, simply execute the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

Copy code
python diabetes_prediction.py
Model
The project uses a Random Forest Classifier from the scikit-learn library to make predictions about whether or not a patient has diabetes based on their health metrics. The model is trained using the data contained in the "diabetes.csv" file, and can make predictions for new patients based on the information provided.

Results
The model is trained on the provided data and then used to make predictions for new patients. The accuracy of the predictions is reported at the end of the program's execution.
